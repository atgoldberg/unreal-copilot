# Post-Mortem: Task 001

## Implementation Summary
- Added a static function `ExecutePythonString` in the plugin module.  
- Used `unreal.PythonScriptLibrary.execute_python_command()` internally.  
- Registered function as BlueprintCallable for testing in editor.  

## Validation
- Executed: `print("Hello from Unreal Python")` successfully printed in Output Log.  
- Executed invalid Python (`prit("oops")`) and error appeared in log without crashing editor.  

## Issues & Notes
- No sandboxing yet: arbitrary Python can still be executed, potential risk.  
- Might need a restricted namespace for production use.  
- Next steps: implement structured error handling & return values.
