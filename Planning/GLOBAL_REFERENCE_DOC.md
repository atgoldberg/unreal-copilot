## Project Vision & Goals

**Unreal Copilot** is an integrated LLM agent plugin for **Unreal Engine** that acts as a **technical artist development partner**. The core vision is to enable users to prompt a selected AI model to perform Unreal technical art and design tasks through natural language interfaces.

### Primary Goals
- **ðŸ”¹ AI-Driven Technical Art Assistant**: Generate and execute Python code in-editor via natural language prompts
- **ðŸ”¹ Task Automation**: Automate repetitive Unreal Editor workflows (level creation, asset setup, animation pipelines)  
- **ðŸ”¹ Extensible LLM Integration**: Support multiple model providers (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, etc.) for flexible access and billing
- **ðŸ”¹ Iterative Development Framework**: Phased development with clear milestones and deliverables

### Technical Vision
The plugin implements a **prompt-to-Python workflow** where:
1. Users enter natural language prompts in the Unreal Editor
2. Selected LLM generates executable Python scripts  
3. Scripts execute safely within Unreal's embedded Python environment
4. Results are displayed with error handling and rollback capabilities

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Plugin Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate core (`UnrealCopilot`) and editor (`UnrealCopilotEditor`) modules
- **Blueprint Integration**: Core functions exposed to Blueprint system for accessibility
- **Event-Driven UI**: Slate-based reactive interface with proper Unreal Editor integration
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking execution for long-running Python operations

### Code Organization
- **Unreal Naming Conventions**: 
  - Classes: `UClassName`, `AActorName`, `FNonUObjectClass`, `SSlateWidget`
  - Functions: `CamelCaseFunctionNames`  
  - Variables: `bPrefixForBooleans`, `CamelCase`
- **Directory Structure**: Standard Unreal plugin layout with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and external references

### Safety & Security Considerations
- **Execution Sandboxing**: Planned for production environments
- **Input Validation**: Multi-layer validation for Python code generation
- **Error Recovery**: Rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- **Resource Management**: Memory and performance monitoring for long operations

- [ ] **No Production Sandboxing**: Full Python access without restrictions
- [ ] **Single Model Support**: No multi-provider LLM integration yet
- [ ] **No Session Persistence**: Execution history not saved between sessions

### Phase 2 Blockers
- [ ] **LLM Provider Selection**: Decision needed between GitHub Copilot vs. direct API integration
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering Strategy**: Template system design for technical art tasks  
- [ ] **Code Generation Safety**: Validation mechanisms for LLM-generated Python
- [ ] **Context Management**: How to provide Unreal project context to LLM
