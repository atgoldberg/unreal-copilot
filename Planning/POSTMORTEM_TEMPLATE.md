# Post-Mortem Template

This template is to be completed by a **Coding Agent** after implementing a task.  
Attach this file to the corresponding task folder (`postmortem_task_<number>.md`).

## Metadata
- **Task ID / Title**:  
- **Author**:  
- **Date**:  
- **UE Version**:  
- **Plugin Commit SHA**:  
- **Artifacts Produced**: (files modified/added, scripts, assets)  

---

## Implementation Summary
- What was implemented and how.  
- Key design or architectural decisions made.  
- Deviations from the task requirements (if any).  

---

## Functional Validation
- Evidence that acceptance criteria were met.  
- Steps taken to manually verify functionality.  
- Logs, screenshots, or test outputs attached.  

---

## Code Quality Notes
- Structure of the code (e.g., modularity, reusability).  
- Documentation included (comments, API usage notes).  
- Any shortcuts or technical debt introduced.  

---

## Conventions & Style
- Adherence to Unreal coding conventions and project standards.  
- Directory/file placement decisions.  
- Naming convention considerations.  

---

## Testing & Validation
- Unit tests written and results.  
- Integration testing performed.  
- Editor validation: what was tested in the Unreal Editor and outcomes.  
- Regression tests (if any) and outcomes.  

---

## Risks & Issues
- Known limitations of the implementation.  
- Potential bugs or areas of fragility.  
- Security/performance considerations (e.g., unsafe Python execution, optimization concerns).  

---

## Recommendations / Next Steps
- Suggested follow-up tasks for Planning Agent.  
- Improvements that could be made later (non-blocking).  
- Open questions or unresolved design considerations.
