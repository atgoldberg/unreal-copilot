# Task 003: Enhanced Python Execution & User Experience

## Objective
Enhance the Python execution system with improved error handling, better user feedback, and execution management features to provide a more robust and user-friendly development environment within the UnrealCopilot plugin.

## Requirements

### Core Enhancements
- Implement detailed Python error reporting with stack traces and line numbers
- Add input validation and basic Python syntax checking before execution
- Create visual execution state feedback (loading, success, error indicators)
- Implement execution history functionality with session persistence
- Add keyboard shortcuts for improved workflow (Ctrl+Enter to execute)

### Error Handling Improvements
- Capture and display Python stack traces with proper formatting
- Provide line number references for syntax errors
- Implement timeout mechanism for long-running Python scripts (configurable, default 30 seconds)
- Add user-friendly error messages for common Python issues
- Create error categorization (syntax errors, runtime errors, timeout errors)

### User Experience Features  
- Add execution status indicators in the UI (spinner, progress feedback)
- Implement command history navigation (Up/Down arrow keys)
- Add clear output functionality with confirmation dialog
- Provide execution time display for performance awareness
- Create auto-save functionality for prompt text

### Files to Modify/Create
- **Modify**: `Plugins/UnrealCopilot/Source/UnrealCopilot/Private/UnrealCopilot.cpp`
  - Enhance `ExecutePythonString` function with detailed error capture
  - Add timeout mechanism and execution state management
- **Modify**: `Plugins/UnrealCopilot/Source/UnrealCopilotEditor/Private/Widgets/SUnrealCopilotWidget.cpp`
  - Add keyboard shortcuts and execution state UI
  - Implement history navigation and visual feedback
- **Create**: `Plugins/UnrealCopilot/Source/UnrealCopilot/Public/UnrealCopilotExecutionManager.h`
  - New class for managing execution state, history, and timeouts
- **Create**: `Plugins/UnrealCopilot/Source/UnrealCopilot/Private/UnrealCopilotExecutionManager.cpp`
  - Implementation of execution management functionality
- **Modify**: `Plugins/UnrealCopilot/Source/UnrealCopilot/UnrealCopilot.Build.cs`
  - Add any additional module dependencies if required

## Implementation Notes

### Python Error Capture Enhancement
- Utilize Python's `sys.exc_info()` and `traceback` module for detailed error reporting
- Implement custom Python error handler that captures stdout/stderr streams
- Consider using `compile()` function for syntax validation before execution
- Integrate with Unreal's logging system for proper error categorization

### Execution State Management
- Create enum for execution states: `Idle`, `Validating`, `Executing`, `Completed`, `Error`, `Timeout`
- Implement thread-safe state management for UI updates
- Use Unreal's `FTSTicker` or similar mechanism for timeout handling
- Consider async execution patterns to prevent UI blocking

### UI/UX Improvements
- Leverage Slate's `SThrobber` widget for execution feedback
- Implement custom input handling for keyboard shortcuts in `SMultiLineEditableTextBox`
- Use Unreal's settings system for execution timeout configuration
- Create history data structure with proper serialization for persistence

### Testing Considerations
- Test various Python error scenarios (syntax errors, runtime exceptions, infinite loops)
- Validate timeout mechanism with long-running scripts
- Verify keyboard shortcuts don't conflict with existing Unreal Editor shortcuts
- Test history persistence across editor sessions

## Acceptance Criteria

### Enhanced Error Reporting
- [ ] Python syntax errors display specific line numbers and error descriptions
- [ ] Runtime exceptions show full stack traces with file references
- [ ] Error messages are formatted clearly and distinguished from successful output
- [ ] Invalid Python code is detected before execution when possible

### Execution Management
- [ ] Long-running Python scripts respect configurable timeout (default 30 seconds)
- [ ] Timeout errors are reported clearly with option to extend or cancel
- [ ] Execution state is visually indicated in the UI (loading spinner, status text)
- [ ] Multiple rapid executions are handled gracefully (queuing or rejection)

### User Experience Features
- [ ] Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut executes Python code from input field
- [ ] Up/Down arrow keys navigate through execution history
- [ ] Command history persists between editor sessions (minimum 50 entries)
- [ ] Clear output functionality available with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Execution time is displayed for each completed operation
- [ ] Prompt text auto-saves to prevent accidental loss

### Code Quality & Integration
- [ ] Plugin compiles successfully with enhanced functionality
- [ ] No regressions in existing Python execution or UI functionality
- [ ] New features integrate seamlessly with existing Task 001 and Task 002 code
- [ ] Error handling follows Unreal Engine logging and exception patterns
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable for typical usage scenarios

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Comprehensive test cases cover error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Manual validation confirms UI responsiveness during execution
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work correctly and don't interfere with editor shortcuts
- [ ] History navigation functions correctly with various command types
- [ ] Timeout mechanism prevents indefinite UI blocking

## Technical Specifications

### Error Capture Implementation
```cpp
// Example structure for enhanced error reporting
struct FPythonExecutionResult
{
    bool bSuccess;
    FString Output;
    FString ErrorMessage;
    FString StackTrace;
    int32 ErrorLineNumber;
    float ExecutionTimeSeconds;
    EPythonExecutionError ErrorType;
};
```

### Execution State Management
- Use Unreal's `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE` for execution state change events
- Implement proper cleanup for interrupted executions
- Thread-safe execution queue for handling multiple requests

### History Management
- Store execution history in Unreal's settings system or dedicated config file
- Implement circular buffer for memory efficiency (configurable max entries)
- Include timestamp and execution result for each history entry

## Dependencies & References
- **Unreal Python API**: Continue using existing `IPythonScriptPlugin` interface
- **Unreal Slate UI**: `SThrobber`, input handling improvements
- **Unreal Settings**: For configuration persistence and timeout settings
- **Python Standard Library**: `traceback`, `sys`, `compile` modules for error handling
- **Threading**: Consider `FRunnable` or `AsyncTask` for non-blocking execution

## Risk Considerations
- **Performance Impact**: Enhanced error capture may add overhead to Python execution
- **UI Responsiveness**: Even with improvements, complex scripts may still impact editor performance  
- **Memory Usage**: History storage and error message capture could increase memory footprint
- **Compatibility**: New features must not break existing Blueprint integration from Task 001
- **Security**: Enhanced error reporting should not expose sensitive system information

## Success Metrics
- Execution errors provide actionable information for debugging Python scripts
- Users can efficiently work with Python code using keyboard shortcuts and history
- Long-running operations don't freeze the Unreal Editor interface
- Plugin remains stable and performant under various usage scenarios
- Integration maintains compatibility with existing functionality while adding value
