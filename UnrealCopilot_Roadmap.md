# Unreal Copilot Development Roadmap

## Phase 1 – Foundations (MVP Plugin & Infrastructure)
- Create a minimal Unreal Editor plugin scaffold (menu entry, dockable UI panel).
- Integrate Python execution pathway (using `unreal.PythonScriptLibrary` or equivalent).
- Establish model API access (OpenAI or GitHub Copilot), with authentication, billing, and quota management.
- Implement basic text-prompt → Python code → execution loop in-editor.
- **Deliverables:** Working plugin, documentation, test cases, simple logging & error-handling.

## Phase 2 – Agent Workflows & Tasking
- Define prompt/task structures (e.g., “agent templates” for materials, blueprints, level editing).
- Add sandbox/preview execution: validate Python before running in main editor context.
- Implement task history and rollback (basic undo/safety).
- Begin integration with GitHub Copilot’s quota/billing.
- **Deliverables:** Agent mode, local task logs, post-mortem .md file output.

## Phase 3 – Authoring Support & Context Awareness
- Expose Unreal API reference context directly to the model (engine code/docs).
- Allow the agent to query project metadata (assets, classes, hierarchies).
- Improve prompt-to-code grounding to reduce hallucinations.
- Add context doc ingestion (like VRM spec, plugin readmes, etc.).
- **Deliverables:** Context pipeline, per-task context packager, verified example tasks.

## Phase 4 – Multi-Agent & QA Layer
- Add “planner” agent to break down tasks into atomic subtasks.
- Add “code reviewer” agent to independently validate generated code vs. requirements.
- Iterative handoff between planner → implementer → reviewer.
- Expand error-handling and reporting pipeline.
- **Deliverables:** Multi-agent orchestration, reviewer reports, structured pipeline.

## Phase 5 – Advanced Editor Integration
- Add support for complex workflows (procedural level generation, rigging, sequence editing).
- Build UI for task selection, execution status, and preview.
- Integrate GitHub/Git for automatic commit hooks tied to tasks.
- **Deliverables:** Copilot Dock UI, reusable task templates, CI hooks.

## Phase 6 – Distribution & Polish
- Marketplace compliance (Fab/UE Marketplace submission requirements).
- Documentation, tutorials, and example projects.
- Stress test with large production project.
- **Deliverables:** Stable v1.0 release candidate, public docs, compliance-ready package.
